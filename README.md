WDI PVD-03 Project #1 - Tic Tac Toe

Overview

My first project at General Assembly was to create a Single Page Application. I was given a list of requirements to adhere to and accomplish. One of our project requirements was to create user stories:


•	The user can register with an email address and password.
•	The user can login with that email and password, sign-out or change passwords.
•	The user can play against another person not a computer.
•	The user can see if he wins. loses or ties.
Several other requirements were:
•	Show user feedback after each action.
•	Provide version control with frequent commits
•	Provide a README file
•	Use jQuery and Ajax for DOM manipulation and for communication between the client and server



Technologies Used:
•	HTML5
•	CSS3
•	SASS
•	Bootstrap
•	JavaScript
•	jQuery
•	Google Fonts

Rules of the game:
-Taking turns mark an 'X' or an 'O' in an unoccupied square.
-A win occurs when a player achieves 3 marked squares in a row...
 either horizontally, vertically or diagonally
-If all squares are marked before either opponent reaches 3 marked squares in a row
 the game results in a tie.
